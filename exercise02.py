Question 2
Write a function that returns the difference in hours between two dates
provided as Python standard ISO formatted strings, rounded to the nearest hour.
For simplicity, assume that these dates do not contain fractional seconds.

For example, given these two dates:

2001-01-01T13:50:23
and

2001-06-12T14:23:50
your result should be 3889 hours.
