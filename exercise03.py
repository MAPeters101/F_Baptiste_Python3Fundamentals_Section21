Question 3
Write a function that can be used to consistently format datetime objects into
strings with some default format, but allows the caller to override the
default format.

For example, the default format could be mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm:ss am/pm, but your
function allows itself to be called with some argument that can override that
format.
